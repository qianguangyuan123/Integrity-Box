<summary><strong>FAQ</strong></summary>

- **What is IntegrityBox?**  
  A complete Play Integrity compatibility and system-signal management toolkit.

- **Who should use IntegrityBox?**  
  Rooted users and custom ROM users who care about Play Integrity reliability.

- **Why was IntegrityBox created?**  
  Honestly? It started because so many people were selling keyboxes and I thought, “this is bad, everyone should have access to this for free.” So I made a tool that just gives you keyboxes without paying a cent. Then, well… I kept adding stuff. I kept improving things, fixing bugs, adding new ways to spoof, hide, clean, and optimize. And before I knew it… it turned into a beast of a module, probably the most powerful Play Integrity Fix anyone’s ever seen. It has so many features now that even I sometimes forget half of them 😭. But yeah, that’s the story: started small, got greedy with features, and now it’s the one-stop solution for anyone who wants STRONG or DEVICE integrity without the headaches. Just flash & forget, no need to do anything manually.

- **Does IntegrityBox replace Play Integrity Fix/Fork module?**  
  Yes! Starting from v28, PIF is fully integrated into IntegrityBox. The module ID was changed to `playintegrityfix` to avoid conflicts, because honestly, using both at the same time doesn’t make sense. IntegrityBox now handles everything PIF did, plus all the extra features I’ve added along the way
  
- **Does IntegrityBox improve compatibility with banking apps**  
  Yes.

  No.

- **Does it run constantly in the background?**  
  No.

- **Is it lightweight?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it increase CPU usage?**  
  No, it may reduce it by optimizing targets.

- **Does it drain battery?**  
  No.

- **Is everything configurable?**  
  Yes.

- **Can features be disabled individually?**

  Disables all experimental features.

- **Can I recover easily if something breaks?**  
  Yes.

- **Is it safe to uninstall?**

  No.

- **Does it include telemetry or tracking?**  
  No.

  No (except optional downloads).

- **Are downloads verified?**  
  Yes, using hash verification.

- **Does it automatically manage target.txt?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it reduce unnecessary Play Services load?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it handle keybox management?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it support multiple keybox injections?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it help with “Device not certified” issues?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it work on all ROMs?**  
  It works best on clean, enforcing AOSP-based ROMs.

- **Is SELinux enforcing recommended?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it support Pixel spoofing?**  
  Yes.

- **Can fingerprints be customized?**  
  Yes.

- **Does it handle ROM-specific spoofing conflicts?**  
  Yes.

- **Is this module actively maintained?**  
  Yes.

- **Is it beginner-friendly?**  
  Yes, with built-in guidance.

- **Is it suitable for advanced users?**  
  Yes.

- **Should I reboot after changes?**  
  Only if you see a popup saying **"Reboot to apply changes"**.

- **Should I reboot after flashing?**  
  Yes.

- **Where should issues be reported?**  
  Through the WebUI report option.

- Spoofs LineageOS-specific property detection
- Spoofs `debug fingerprint` detection
- Supports custom pixel beta fingerprint configuration

<summary><strong>Common Failure Reasons</strong></summary>

Play Integrity may fail if any of the following conditions are present:

- **SELinux is set to `permissive`**
- **Higher Play Store version (higher than 40.xx)**
- **Conflicting Magisk / KernelSU / LSPosed modules**
- **Revoked or invalid keybox**
- **Banned fingerprint**
- **ROM inbuilt GMS spoofing is enabled (create `/sdcard/zygisk` & flash IntegrityBox if you want to use ROM's inbuilt spoofing with IntegrityBox)**
- **ROM inbuilt Play Store spoofing is enabled**
- **Root access is visible or not properly hidden**
- **IntegrityBox is not updated to the latest version**
- **Tricky Store is out of sync and requires reflashing**

Ensure all requirements are met and recheck this list before reporting an issue.

<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

Google Play Integrity has fully replaced SafetyNet and is now the only attestation system used by modern apps. It checks whether a device looks *trustworthy and close to a certified Android environment*. Because of this, failures are common on outdated, heavily modified, or poorly configured systems.

Play Integrity checks do **not** only look at root status. They evaluate multiple system signals, including ROM configuration, SELinux state, system hooks, and how Google services behave at runtime.

To reduce false negatives and improve reliability:

- **Use a ROM with SELinux set to `enforcing`.**  
  ROMs running in permissive mode are frequently flagged. Even if everything else looks fine, permissive SELinux alone can cause integrity checks to fail.

- **Keep Google Play Services and the Play Store fully up to date.**  
  Play Integrity relies on Play Services to perform attestation. Old or mismatched versions can break communication with Google’s servers and lead to unexpected failures.

- **Avoid system-level frameworks that hook core services.**  
  Xposed, LSPosed, or similar frameworks, especially modules that interact with Google Play Services or the Play Store, are a common cause of integrity failures. Even “harmless” hooks can be detected.

- **Minimize invasive system modifications.**  
  Changes such as aggressive build.prop spoofing, signature spoofing, or runtime code injection increase the likelihood of detection unless they are carefully handled.

- **Keep the system as close to stock behavior as possible.**  
  The closer your device behaves to a certified, unmodified Android environment, the more consistent Play Integrity results will be.

Play Integrity is stricter than older systems and is actively updated by Google. Passing checks today does not guarantee passing them forever, especially on custom ROMs. Treat integrity passing as something that requires maintenance, not a one-time setup.
